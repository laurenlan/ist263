    Lauren Lanahan 

 

    I am currently a sophomore at Syracuse University studying Information Management and Technology in the School of Information. I grew up in Palo Alto, California so my whole world has always been centered around technology and the fast-growing market it has. Social media has always been an interest of mine and how users interact with technology and HCI is what I hope to do in the future.  
    
    In the past I was the Editor-in-chief of my high school yearbook for three years and was also a photographer in high school having my photos published in multiple local magazines. During high school I also swam competitively and traveled for my club team.  Here at SU, I was a photographer for University Girl an on-campus magazine and am part of club water polo here on campus.  
    
    Outside of my academics and extracurricular activities I enjoy spending time with my family and friends and traveling to new places. Half my family lives in France so I have also spent a great deal of time in Europe when I was growing up.
