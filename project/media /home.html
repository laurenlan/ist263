    Banksy. One of the most well recognized artists in modern day. Their art has been pictured all over <br>
     the world and oftentimes brings a frenzy of Banksy lovers like myself <br>
    to the location within a few minutes of it being posted to social media or on another platform. <br>
    But who is this artist? Well your guess is as good as mine! One of the greatest mysteries in the current art world is who <br>
    is this artist with 11.2 million followers on instagram and following no one, creating almost <br> parody-like art about the world, and the
    fifth best selling artist in the world. While they have traveled the world, made books, and even a movie titled The Exit Through the Gift Shop, the only thing <br>
    people can confidently say is that the artist is from the Bristol area of the United Kingdom.
