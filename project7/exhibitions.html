    Currently you can view a Banksy collection at the Palace of Fine Arts in San Francisco until February 27th, 2022. <br>
    Prices range from forty to fifty dollars and availability is limited as this is a private show, however it is on tour throughout the country.

   Girl with Balloon sold in 2018 for a crazy $1,135,219 even though no one estimated it would sell for that high.

    While the best way to see Banksy's art is on the street there are exhibitions all over the world which house some of their prints and wall graffiti pieces.

    If you want to see an original piece however, I highly recommend following Banksy on Instagram as they are often posting their new pieces on their account. <br>
     Searching the web for locations where the art is still up is also a great way to find their art!
