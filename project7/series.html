<p>
    From Park City, Utah to Paris to New Orleans, Banksy has done it all however oftentimes Banksy targets areas of the world that are facing hardships. <br>
     One series he did in Bethlehem in 2005 depicts 9 small scenes across the 435 mile long west bank barrier. As seen, they are mocking the current issues  <br>
     going on within Palestine and trying to bring awareness to the issues they face.

    Above is a photo of myself in the fifth grade in Bethlehem after he had done a few pieces. <br>
    As you can see the young girl is patting down an officer shedding light and laughter to the issues between Palestine and Israel.

<h4>New York, New York</h4>

<p>
    In New York City, New York in 2014 Banksy did 31 works of art in 31 days for the month of October. <br>
    Each piece brought a frenzy of fans all over the city from Tribeca to the Meatpacking district.
</p>

<p>
    As seen above Banksy completed this piece in honor of 9/11, using a flower for the explosion and a black silhouette of the Twin Towers. 
</p>
<p>
    Banksy uses a stenciling like method for their graffiti as well as spray paint. One thing to note however <br>
     is that many graffiti artists do not consider Banksy to be a graffiti artist as they do not do it free hand <br>
     meaning Banksy does not do it as they go. Banksy has a plan before doing their pieces, and when they were completing <br>
     their series in NYC, many graffiti artists would show up to spray paint over it or add their own tag in order to ridicule their art.

    As seen above this installation depicts a van driving around the Meatpacking industry with stuffed animals crying.
