    Banksy. One of the most well recognized artists in modern day. Their art <br>
     has been pictured all over the world and oftentimes brings a frenzy of Banksy lovers like myself <br>
    to the location within a few minutes of it being posted to social media or on another platform. <br>
    But who is this artist? Well your guess is as good as mine! One of the greatest mysteries in the <br> 
    current art world is who is this artist with 11.2 million followers on instagram and following no <br> 
    one, creating almost parody-like art about the world, and the fifth best selling artist in the world.<br> 
    While they have traveled the world, made books, and even a movie titled The Exit Through the Gift Shop, <br>
     the only thing people can confidently say is that the artist is from the Bristol area of the United Kingdom.

    Understandably, Banksy does not want to reveal their identity as they are doing <br>
    illegal art work on public property however it ironically makes their art more valuable.

   Through Banksy's art we see a comedic approach to the problems of the world. The artist's goal is for the public to enjoy it however oftentimes it is carved out of the wall and sold at auctions for millions. <br>
   Most recently their self shredded art sold for 25.4 million dollars becoming more valuable after it self destructed at a Sotheby's auction making it one of the highest selling pieces in his collection. However, <br>
   Banksy makes zero profit from his art that has sold, and ridicules his followers and the art world for constantly being in it for the money.
